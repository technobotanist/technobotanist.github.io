## 🧠 About Me

I make interactive and user-centered products in educational contexts. Typically, these products involve software and hardware components. At the NC State University Libraries, I'm deeply involved in the development of creative technology workflows for experiential learning, immersive research, and staffing of makerspaces within [‘The Studios’](https://www.lib.ncsu.edu/the-studios). At [MTR Magic Key](https://www.mtrmagickey.com), I design and deploy interactive exhibits, embedded AI, real-time graphics, and physical interfaces for our clients (largely museums and civic spaces). My work emphasizes open formats, long-term maintainability, and community utility.
