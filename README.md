## 🧠 About Me

I'm a systems builder across educational, public, and interactive contexts. At NC State, I lead development of creative technology workflows for experiential learning, immersive research, and scholarly communication. At [MTR Magic Key](https://www.mtrmagickey.com), I design and deploy embedded AI, real-time graphics, and physical interfaces for museums and civic spaces. My work emphasizes open formats, long-term maintainability, and community utility.
