## Signature XR and Interactive Systems (2023-2025)
### WEDGE - Wireless Ergonomic Dynamic Gesture Enhancer
MIT Reality Hack 2024 | Hardware Hack and Augmented Productivity tracks
- Built a fully wireless ESP32 peripheral that keeps bidirectional Bluetooth state with Meta Quest 2 via the Singularity Unity library, enabling synchronized haptics and telemetry without tethered PCs.
- Co designed a triangular chassis with modular faceplates so teams can swap buttons, LEDs, and sensors for accessibility needs in minutes.
- Produced Unity toy scenes, music loops, and documentation that spotlight asymmetric play between headset users and bystanders, framing WEDGE as an inclusive productivity tool.

### Dueling Dinosaurs Camera Interactive
NC Museum of Natural Sciences, SECU DinoLab | MTR Magic Key LLP
- Architected a 4K live video stack with four Sony SRG XB25 PTZ cameras, Matrox Maevex encoders, and a Dell R750 Linux media server so visitors can observe fossil prep work in real time.
- Built a browser based kiosk (Windows kiosk mode) backed by Drupal JsonAPI content and OpenCV/Python timelapse pipelines, keeping media fresh with zero vendor touch.
- Delivered staff friendly publishing workflows that let museum educators surface new lab stories within existing schedules.

### Dueling Dinosaurs Fossil Prep Interactive
NC Museum of Natural Sciences | Unity based touchscreen kiosk
- Took over a prototype Unity build and productionized it into a durable visitor experience where guests excavate virtual fossils using tuned tool physics and tactile feedback.
- Added tool selection menus, timed challenges, and instructional overlays that mirror SECU DinoLab procedures, reinforcing care and sequencing.

### Zoetone - 3D Web Audio Visualizer
MTR Magic Key LLP
- Authored an A Frame WebXR experience with a custom Web Audio pipeline so performers can upload six independent channels, each powering distinct GLB animations in real time.
- Solved autoplay and CORS issues for museum kiosks and Meta Quest headsets, ensuring one build works across classrooms and exhibits.
- Positioned Zoetone as a remixable creative coding platform for live visuals and signal processing instruction.

### Mocking Board - Lofi Internet Signage
MTR Magic Key LLP
- Delivered a pure HTML/CSS/JavaScript signage tool that turns any browser into an editable sign with animated gradients, typography, and imagery.
- Added JSON import/export plus undo/redo so staff can script content, leverage LLM prompts, or quickly reset for recurring events.
- Optimized rendering for low power devices, letting schools redeploy legacy hardware as signage endpoints.

### VRPlants and The Naturalist's Workshop
NC State University Libraries + NCSU Plant and Microbial Biology
- Co led VRPlants, an open VR curriculum showcasing 3D scanned herbarium specimens across Unity and WebXR workflows for instructors.
- Shipped The Naturalist's Workshop to SideQuest, reaching about 1,700 downloads and a top 50 education ranking while supplying lesson plans for faculty adoption.
- Presented outcomes at Harvard Library Discovery Series and other venues to accelerate immersive pedagogy uptake.
